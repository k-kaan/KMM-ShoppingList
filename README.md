# KMM-ShoppingList [WIP]
This is an offline shopping list for iOS and Android made by **Kotlin Multiplatform** and the UI is built entirely with **SwiftUI/Compose** and the shopping list items are stored in a **SQLite** database.

You can create items, update the state of the items, swipe to delete them and all the changes on the database are shown through **Kotlin Flow** on our UI. Note that the project has several experimental features like the new memory model of Kotlin to avoid concurrency issues, or the library [KMP-NativeCoroutines](https://github.com/rickclephas/KMP-NativeCoroutines) for using Kotlin Flow in Swift.
